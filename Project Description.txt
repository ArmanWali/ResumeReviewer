# 🎯 Project Report: JobMatch AI: The Hyper-Targeted Resume Reviewer

## I. Executive Summary

**JobMatch AI** is a specialized web application designed to eliminate the guesswork from the job application process. It moves beyond generic, keyword-matching tools by leveraging a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture built on proprietary, company-specific knowledge.

The core function is simple: a user uploads a resume and the specific job description they are applying for. The application then analyzes the resume against the implicit and explicit requirements of the target company—not just general best practices—to provide a precise **Company-Fit Score** and line-by-line, actionable feedback.

## II. Core Problem & Solution

### A. The Problem
The modern job market is broken for applicants. Generic resume advice and general-purpose tools fail because they do not account for the unique, often unstated, internal hiring criteria of specific companies. A resume optimized for an Amazon role (focused on Leadership Principles) will fail the implicit tests for a specific bank role (focused on compliance and regulatory experience). Job seekers waste time using generic feedback that leads to rejection by specialized AI screeners and hiring managers.

### B. The Solution
**JobMatch AI** solves this by creating a highly customized knowledge layer. We do not just pass text to a generic Large Language Model (LLM); we augment the LLM's intelligence with **verified, company-specific data**. This ensures every piece of feedback is relevant to the exact role at the exact company.

## III. The Unique Value Proposition (The Technical Moat)

Our competitive edge lies in the **Proprietary Knowledge Layer** and the RAG architecture:

* **Proprietary Knowledge Database:** We maintain and continuously update a dedicated vector database containing structured data extracted from thousands of successful resumes, company-specific language guides, and internal priority principles (e.g., syntax preferred by specific banking or multinational tech companies operating in localized markets like Pakistan).
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** When a user initiates a review, our system does not rely solely on the LLM's general training data. Instead, our backend **retrieves** the most relevant, company-specific context from our private database and **augments** the LLM prompt. This forces the LLM to ground its analysis and feedback in our unique, verified dataset, producing feedback that a standard LLM chat interface cannot replicate.
* **Structured Output:** We enforce the LLM to return feedback in a precise **JSON format**, which allows us to deliver structured, easy-to-read feedback, including a specific score, visual gap analysis, and tailored suggestions, rather than just a block of text.

## IV. Technical Architecture & Workflow

The application operates via a robust three-step API workflow:

1.  **Input Collection:** The Web Application (Frontend) sends the parsed text of the user's resume and the pasted Job Description (JD) to the Python Backend API (built using Flask or FastAPI).
2.  **Context Augmentation:**
    * The API identifies the target company and role from the JD.
    * It queries the **Vector Database** to retrieve the relevant company-specific linguistic and criteria documents via the RAG process.
    * The API constructs a highly detailed, proprietary **System Prompt** that includes the user's resume, the JD, **and** the retrieved company-specific RAG context.
3.  **Analysis and Delivery:**
    * The API sends the augmented prompt to the external **LLM API** (e.g., Gemini).
    * The LLM processes the request and returns a structured **JSON response**.
    * The Backend API validates and transmits the clean JSON data back to the Frontend. The Frontend then renders the results in an engaging, actionable report format.
